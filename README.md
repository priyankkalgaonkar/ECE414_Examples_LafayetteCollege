This repository contains several examples which we will use in class and lab.  You are welcome to download and use these files as a starting point for your lab assignments, but follow the course policy of crediting the source of code you are using.

Several of these examples are based on code in the Raspberry Pi Pico examples repository and Hunter Adams' ECE 4760 examples repository from Cornell University. Repository adopted from Prof. Dr. John Nestor.
